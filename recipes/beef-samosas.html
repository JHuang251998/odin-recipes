    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Beef samosas are savory pastries filled with a delectable mixture of
      minced or ground beef, onions, garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices. The
      filling is cooked until the beef is tender and the flavors have melded
      together. It is then enclosed in a thin pastry shell, typically folded
      into a triangular shape and either deep-fried or baked until crispy and
      golden. These triangular delights are enjoyed as a popular snack or
      appetizer, often served hot and accompanied by chutneys or sauces.

      crispy exterior or relishing the flavorful filling, beef samosas provide a
      delightful burst of taste and texture that is sure to satisfy your

      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>

      <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped green chile peppers</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in
        potatoes and peas; cook until potatoes are tender but still firm, about
        15 minutes. Drain, mash together, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium-high
        heat. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf; stir until fragrant and seeds are
        browned. Add ground beef and onions; cook until beef is browned and
        crumbly and onions are soft, about 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in garlic and ginger. Season with salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric,
        chili powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and black pepper. Stir in the mashed
        potato mixture. Remove from heat and chill in the refrigerator for 1
        hour, or until cool.
      </li>
      <li>Heat 1 quart of oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Mix cilantro and green chile peppers into potato and beef mixture. Place
        approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto each phyllo sheet. Fold
        sheets into triangles, pressing edges together with moistened fingers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower samosas carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden
        brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
        Repeat with remaining samosas. Serve warm.
