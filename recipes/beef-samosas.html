    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Beef samosas are savory pastries filled with a delectable mixture of
      minced or ground beef, onions, garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices. The
      filling is cooked until the beef is tender and the flavors have melded
      together. It is then enclosed in a thin pastry shell, typically folded
      into a triangular shape and either deep-fried or baked until crispy and
      golden. These triangular delights are enjoyed as a popular snack or
      appetizer, often served hot and accompanied by chutneys or sauces.

      occasions, parties, or as a quick snack. Whether you're biting into the
      crispy exterior or relishing the flavorful filling, beef samosas provide a
      delightful burst of taste and texture that is sure to satisfy your
      cravings.
