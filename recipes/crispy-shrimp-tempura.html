      Crispy shrimp tempura is a popular Japanese dish where fresh shrimp are
      coated in a light batter and deep-fried until they become golden and
      crispy. The shrimp are seasoned, dipped in a batter made from flour and
      water, and then quickly fried to perfection. The result is succulent

      technique that highlights the delicate flavors of seafood and vegetables
      by coating them in a crispy batter. Crispy shrimp tempura is beloved for
